# IsPrime
 Determines if the given number is a Prime or not, then at a later time wether it is Deletable or not.
 
 A number is Prime if it can be cleanly divided only by 1 or itself.
 
 If removing any single digit still results in a prime, and if shrinking it down to one digit it still remains a prime,
 then the "original" was a Deletable Prime; if also true, the number of viable "routes" are to be noted. Examples:
 
* 4125673 : 12 -> prime
* 41256793 : 21 -> prime
* 537430451 : 3 -> prime
* 200899998 : 0 -> NOT prime
* 537499093 : 8 -> prime
* 2147483059 : 8 -> prime
